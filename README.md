# TinyAdventure2
A little sequel to my first game Tiny Adventure still got a lot of work to do on it but would like to get some more eyes on it.

Again I'm following along with the Youtuber RyiSnow on his series called "How to Make a Text Adventure Game with GUI" with this code import it 
into you IDE and run it through if the text doesn't load try resizing the window (still try to figure out why that happens).

I have not added the funtion for the buttons but I'm working on it if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate the help and also 
constructive critisim is welcomed.

Thank you for taking your time to check out my little game if you would like to talk about 
working together on a project or just say Hi send me a message on here or drop an email at emiliosoliz92@gmail.com
